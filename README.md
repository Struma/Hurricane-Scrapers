# Hurricane scripts

This is a repo that contains scripts relevant to hurricanes.


I am particularly interested in compositing hurricane gifs into videos to watch the hurricne season and the developments of the storms as they change week to week. I use my PI Zero server in order to run these jobs daily in the cron.


```bash
00 00 */1 * * cd /location/dir/of/script/ && python3 python_script.py
```

I think weekly videos would be a cool place to start.
